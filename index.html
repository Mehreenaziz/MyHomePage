      <p> Hey Everyone!<br><br>
        My name is pronounced like “marine” – I thought I’d start with this as it’s usually one of the first questions I’m asked. I have a great passion for Science, Technology and Communication! I love to see concepts and information come to life with the use of technology! I can't wait to start my journey with Code Your Future, I am in the right place and hands to explore my passion. My first encounter with coding was back in the 2000's. I would create websites on various platforms and also add HTML to my MySpace profile to add a personal touch. In the last couple of years, my passion for coding reignited as I see so much potential of what can be achieved through technology, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The world seemingly changed overnight, a lot of people stepped up to create new solutions to new human issues - not only to do with physical health, but also mental well-being. I am a very creative person at heart, I've always flourished in environments that nurture my creativity. My preferred method of learning is always practical, which is why this course has been incredibly fun so far! I look forward to what is to come. <br><br>See below a video of me visiting my home country. The location is the Baadshah Masjid in Lahore, which is a famous historical landmark, also very beautiful.</p>

      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
      <p> I moved to London in 1994 from Pakistan as an asylum seeker and have mostly lived in west London since. I did my bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry at King’s College London, and I’ve worked in the lab at the University of Leeds on neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease. Since my time in
        the lab, I’ve worked in a couple of commercial roles - in life science conferences and then as a Virtual Representative at GSK (pre- and post-Covid19). I've learned so much during my career and can not help but feel so grateful that I have had the privilege of education, which is unfortunately not offered to many girls where I am from.<br> <br> Being multicultural, and a first generation immigrant, I have never felt like I fully belonged to any one particular country. But now, I embrace all aspects of my culture - both British and Pakistani! I am a huge advocate for human rights, especially when it comes to access to education. I believe that should be a right for every child and adult, not a privilege. Below are a couple pictures of me:</p><br>
